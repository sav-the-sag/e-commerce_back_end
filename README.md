# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

# Description
My challenge this week was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I was given a working Express.js API and instructed to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Testing was completed in Insomnia. The application will not be deployed, so a video walkthrough is provided below.

# User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
